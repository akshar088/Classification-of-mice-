# Classification of mice based on Protein Expression levels
This repository contains the work I completed during my internship as a Data Science Intern at Evoastra Ventures. The project focuses on classifying mice based on their protein expression levels. The methodology involved several key steps: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, model evaluation, and reporting.

During data preprocessing, I cleaned and transformed raw data, handled missing values and outliers, and normalized and scaled the data for optimal performance. The EDA phase involved analyzing the data to uncover patterns and insights, and visualizing data distributions and relationships. For feature selection, I applied various techniques to identify the most significant features and reduced dimensionality to enhance model performance.

In the model training phase, I implemented and fine-tuned multiple machine learning algorithms. Model evaluation was conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliability and effectiveness. Finally, I compiled detailed reports and analysis to present the findings.
